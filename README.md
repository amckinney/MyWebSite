# Polls Application
A web application built with PHP and CodeIgniter, using a MySQL database. Other software used includes Angular, CSS, and a RESTful API. <br />
Polls is an application that provides users with a list of 'polls' that they can vote on. Total views can be viewed, and other functionality includes creating and deleting polls. Users can also reset the number of votes on a particular poll without deleting the original copy. <br />
This app was built while I was in New Zealand, so there is currently no hosting for the database. I encourage you to read through the php and angular code to get a better sense for how I built it!
